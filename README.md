# Liamfin

This is my custom build(s) of [Project Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.io/) using the [ublue image template](https://github.com/ublue-os/image-template).
In summary I install a few packages I need installed on all of my systems, then remove a handful of packages (mostly extensions) that I don't need.
I also provide a `/post-install.sh` script that is manually run after installation to add and remove some Flatpaks.
